# Magic Patterns - Vite Template

This code was generated by [Magic Patterns](https://magicpatterns.com) for this design: [Source Design](https://www.magicpatterns.com/c/w4r2jpbaarqjgrjsoirwiw)

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev`

## PDF Export

The app now includes a PDF export button in the preview pane (desktop). Click **Export PDF** to download your CV as an A4 PDF. This uses `html2pdf.js` to capture the preview and save it as `cv.pdf`.

## Manual verification

1. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
2. Open the app in a desktop browser (the preview/export button is only visible on larger screens).
3. Fill in some details in the form and click **Export PDF** on the preview pane.
4. Confirm a file named `cv.pdf` is downloaded and that the layout looks as expected (A4 portrait).

If you see issues with fonts or layout, try increasing `html2canvas.scale` in `src/pages/CVBuilder.tsx`.
